            <p>Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 â€“ September 7, 2018), known professionally as Mac Miller, was
                an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>

                    Records, with whom he had his breakthrough with the mixtapes K.I.D.S. and Best Day Ever. Miller's
                    debut studio album, Blue Slide Park, became the first independently distributed debut album to top
                    the US Billboard 200 since 1995.</li>

            <h3>Artistry</h3>
            <h6>Musical style and progression</h6>
            <p>Early in his career, Miller's music was widely regarded as "frat rap", with lyrics focusing on partying,
                smoking marijuana, and lusting after fame, money, and women. After the mixed critical response of Blue
                Slide Park, Miller began to employ a more expressive and experimental approach to his subsequent
                releases.</p>
            <h6>Influences</h6>
            <p>Miller included Big L, Lauryn Hill, Beastie Boys, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest among his influences.
                He had a close relationship with fellow Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa, saying "Wiz has been a big
                brother to me with this music thing so far. Our relationship is beyond music. He really is just my
                homie, whether I will be making music or not.</p>

            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>On September 7, 2018, Miller was found unresponsive in his Studio City home by his personal assistant,
                who called 911 and performed CPR until paramedics arrived. Miller was pronounced dead at the scene at
                11:51 a.m. (PDT). He had been scheduled for a video shoot on the day of his death, and was to embark on
                his Swimming Tour in October. In his will, Miller named his mother, father, and brother as
                beneficiaries. He was buried at Homewood Cemetery in his hometown of Pittsburgh, in a Jewish funeral. On
                November 5, 2018, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office determined that Miller died from an accidental
                drug overdose due to a "mixed drug toxicity" of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol.</p>
